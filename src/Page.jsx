          <p className="about-description">
            For many people with rare diseases, chronic conditions, or severe
            injuries, plasma-based therapies are the only way to help them heal.
            When you donate plasma and platelets with PlasmaSource, you can rest
            easy knowing your donation goes to those who need it most. Plasma
            and its lifesaving proteins cannot be created in a lab, so hospitals
            and healthcare providers rely on a steady flow of plasma donations
            to treat their patients. With your donations, hospitals and
            physicians can effectively treat serious disorders and injuries like

            Donated plasma that is not earmarked for immediate use is tested,
            transported to our state-of-the-art laboratory, and frozen within 24
            hours to preserve its integrity and valuable blood clotting factors.
            Frozen donations can be stored for up to one year and thawed as
            needed. Donated plasma that is earmarked for immediate use is tested
            and transported to our state-of-the-art laboratory or one of our
            partners across Illinois. Whether your donation is used immediately,
            or frozen for future use, it will undergo PRT (Pathogen Reduction
            Technology) to detect and remove any bacterial contaminations and
            emerging infections to help prevent transfusion-transmitted disease.
